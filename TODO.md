# TODO

- ~~sockets are spaghetti, i should rewrite them and also add socks proxies support~~ fuck it
- make comments to every functions and objects
- rotating proxies (maybe)
- subclient -> client (it should be one class where you can set default ndcId, if no ndcId/aminoId it just works like global client, maybe i should also add ndcId parameter to functions that can be executed in global and in community)
