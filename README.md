## Astericks

ยน So there is things becoming tricky. Python3.10 officially added `|` between types and None. HTTPX supporting python3.8+, `__future__` solved problems for python3.9x at least (i tested). So *maybe* lib is compactable with python3.8+, but I just never tested this and I need your help.
